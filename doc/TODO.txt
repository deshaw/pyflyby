- Support removing imports at any level, not just top-level.
- Support adding imports inside functions.  Guess that an import should be
  local if there were any other local imports from the same module.
- Allow options in .pyflyby files such as __options__ = '--uniform'
- Allow an option in .pyflyby files that means "stop processing further
  database files"
- Heuristically guess alignment style from existing code
- Grouping: Teach tidy-imports to canonicalize import groups.  3 possiblities:
  (1) Follow PEP8 standard library imports, then third-party imports, then
  local app imports. http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports. Best
  default. (2) The Eclipse way: for each top-level package, if there is more
  than one import statement, then make those a group.  (3) User-configured
  grouping.
- Use rope?
- Allow comments in a file to specify imports that shouldn't be removed,
  including "*" to mean don't-remove-any.
- Allow a comment in the file to specify alignment options.
- Guess the module name for relative imports.
- Preserve comments on import lines (as much as possible anyway - may need to
  make them standalone comments).
- Preserve line ending style (\r\n).
- Merge share/pyflyby/*.py into a single file.
- Make sure etc/pyflyby works for both systemwide installation and virtualenv
  installation
- Consider making the default database file more like a sample file that the
  user is instructed to cp to ~/.pyflyby.  What about existing users of older
  versions?  Perhaps have an auto-upgrade feature
- Refactor autoimport.py to share more with rest of pyflyby, esp AST parsing.
- Consider __mandatory_imports -= [...] instead of __forget_imports__=[...].
- Packaging:
    - Make 'install' put etc in /etc outside egg (but inside virtualenv is
      ok).  Or think about the right way to do config files otherwise.
    - Avoid compiling etc files to .pyc.
    - Make bin/tidy-imports work out of the box after sdist+unpack.  Currently
      sdist doesn't include the bin/pyflyby symlink.
    - Make zip-safe/PEP308 compliant; use pkg_resources (if possible) instead
      of __file__.
- If fail to import something, remove it (and children) from known imports.
- Autopython script
- Make naming consistent: auto_importer vs autoimporter


- Add pretty-printing parameter --groupimports=manual|pep8|java, new default
  pep8.
- Pep8 grouping:
    - stdlib, then third-party libs, then first-party libs
    - guess whether the current file is in the same package as an
      import by checking if imported_pkg.split(".")[0] in filename.split("/").
    - But how do we distinguish some random local module from third-party
      libraries?  Import it and check if path is in sys.path excluding current
      dir?  Not satisfying but can't think of anything better.
    - stdlib before third-party libs.  Need a list of stdlibs.
      I guess we should include e.g. argparse regardless of the python version,
      since we don't want the grouping to change depending on python version.
      Maybe just use a (cogged) hardcoded list of modules.

- pyflyby_path importdb: require that components start with "/" or "./" or
  ".../"; i.e. don't allow "foo/bar"; tell user to use "./foo/bar" if that's
  what he wants.  Test case.
- Pyflyby_path: make sure that empty strings are ignored, not treated as ".".
  Test case.
- py --safe: pyflyby_path=":" (not empty string, because that means "use
  default")

- Allow non-imports in import db?  Warn or allow silently?  Indicate mode
  somehow? We want to allow setting pyflyby_path to the directory of code and
  use it without having to maintain an importdb.  But don't make regular
  .pyflyby databases sloppy.

- collect-exports: new mode that parses file and enumerates "stores", instead
  of executing code.

- Unify collect-imports/collect-exports/collect-exports-from-stores into a
  single script with a mode argument.  Also parameters for whether to include
  things imported from submodules (default on) and whether to include things
  imported from other packages (default off).

- Add tidy-imports, etc to py

- Merge contents of all scripts into modules, and use setup.py entry_points.
  Keep stub scripts in bin directory only for non-installed usage.

- Support pypy.  It seems to already work fine in casual tests, but tox and
  maybe setup.py need tweaking

- Transforms: support 'from a import b' => 'from c import d' (plus global
  replace b=>d) in addition to 'from a import b' => 'from c import d as b'

- Make tidy-imports support detecting that print_function is necessary but
  missing, and add it.

- Tidy-imports for notebooks: add all necessary imports to cells (either at
  the top or per cell)

- Fix issue where properties get evaluated by pyflyby and then again by
  ipython.  E.g. repeated print output in test_complete_symbol_nonmodule_1.
  We can't avoid pyflyby evaluating the property.  But is there some way to
  intercept ipython's subsequent evaluation and reuse the same result?

- Spyder: Fix pyflyby output coming during tab completion messing up the
  display.  May need to fix in Spyder itself.

- Handle comments between concatenate strings, e.g.: 'myvar =
  ("xx"\n#blah\n"yy")', e.g. in test_interactive.py.

- Function & interactive command to automatically add interactively-typed
  imports to ~/.pyflyby.

- Store all interactively-typed imports to an area that can be consulted to
  print out but don't automatically use

- Integration with search pydoc index for where to get import - but don't use
  it automatically, just print it out and ask user if he wants to add it to
  database
